In an effort to help teach concepts about Dependency Injection (DI) using Swift, I went through [@NatashaTheRobot](https://twitter.com/NatashaTheRobot)'s [**Unit Testing in Swift: Dependency Injection** blog post](https://www.natashatherobot.com/unit-testing-swift-dependency-injection/) and implemented her approach using the now-current version of Swift (2.1.1) with a few additional tweaks:
* Changed the approach from Method Injection to Constructor (Initializer) Injection
* Made use of protocol extensions
* Appoached development using more of a TDD style
* Gave examples of both synchronous and asynchronous invocations to illustrate the difference between them
